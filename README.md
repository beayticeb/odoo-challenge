Odoo second exercise: 
I used Visual Studio Code to build this mock-up, I worked with SCSS and compiled it into a CSS file, so in this way the browser could read it easily. 
For he layout, I used Bootstrap 5.3.2, as requested, and I added some hover effects to make the page feel more alive, and I used @media queries to make sure everything looks in order on mobile too. As you can see, I also added many comments inside all the code to keep the different sections organized and it also helped me stay on track and keep the code clean and easy to follow. 


#What do you find good/bad in this mock-up?#
First of all, I can say the mock-up works really well from a visual point of view. The hieracy is clear, and the general user experience is fluent. The Hero section immediately grabs attention, thanks to the strong blue tone which gives a sense of reliability and professionalism without feeling too heavy, and the tilted line that gives dinamicity easily. One part I particularly liked is the 'Manage Cards'section because I think the layout is clean and well organized, especially the financial information,
which can easily look overwhelming, feels approachable and modern here.
On the other hand, there are a couple of areas that could be improved: the 'Helpful Answers' section is always a good asset to put on, but, while the two-column layout looks balanced on desktop, it might become harder to read on smaller screens, if our goal is a responsive layout too; also, the logos in the "Trusted by" section look elegant, but they could not satisfy the accessibility rules (WCAG)


#What would you improve?#
I'd mainly focus on improving the mobile experience and adding a sticky header with a subtle blur effect would help keep the 'Buy Now' call-to-action visible as users scroll through longer sections of the page. Small details like hover states and smooth
transitions on buttons and cards would also make a big difference. With all of those subtle animations there is an instant feedback that makes the interface look more dynamic and responsive, rather than static.


#What would you change?#
If I was to rethink a few elements, I'd start with the FAQ section: as I anticipated in the first part, I'd replace the two-column 'Helpful Answers' layout with a centered, single-column accordion. This would create a clearer reading flow and naturally adapt better to mobile devices. I'd also revisit the 'Hero section': instead of using a static credit card image, I'd introduce a
layered parallax effect, with both the card and background elements moving slightly to create depth. A subtle tilt effect on mouse movement could add an extra touch of interactivity. It's a small change, but it would turn a static mock-up into something more immersive and forward-thinking, immediately communicating innovation.
